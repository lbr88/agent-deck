// The reaper walks down from the pane PID and skips the tool process, because
// tmux's pgroup kill-session owns that one. Which depth the tool sits at is not
// fixed: agent-deck execs the agent where it can, so an exec'd pane is led by
// the agent itself and its MCP children are one level down, while a pane still
// led by a shell keeps the tool at depth 1 and the MCP children at depth 2.
//
// Hardcoding either depth breaks the other half. A fixed 2 leaves exec'd panes
// with nothing registered at all, so the issue #965 defence against
// setsid-escaping MCP children never arms for them; a fixed 1 would SIGTERM the
// tool in shell-led panes and trip the cosmetic teardown error.
