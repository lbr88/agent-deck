// mcpReapGracePeriod is how long we wait after SIGTERM before escalating
// to SIGKILL on a tracked MCP child. Stdio MCP children generally exit
// immediately when their stdio is closed, so anything that survives this
// window is almost certainly stuck and needs the harder signal.
//
// Raised from 500ms → 1s in the issue #1086 fix: on CI runners under
// the race detector, scheduler latency between the SIGTERM and the
// child's libc signal handler can exceed 500ms, causing a spurious
// SIGKILL escalation that races with the child's already-in-flight
// exit.

// mcpReapMinDepth returns the shallowest depth below the pane PID at which a

// command name.

// The two spawn shapes put the tool at different depths:
//
//	shell-led pane:  sh (0) -> claude (1) -> MCP server (2)
//	agent-led pane:  claude (0)           -> MCP server (1)
//
// agent-deck execs the agent wherever it can, which makes the agent the pane
// leader and leaves nothing at depth 1 but its own children. Tools that are
// not exec'd (or panes whose leader is a login shell) keep the older shape,
// where depth 1 is the tool and must not be pre-empted. Assuming a single
// depth silently drops one of the two: hardcoding 2 leaves agent-led panes
// with no #965 defence at all, and hardcoding 1 would SIGTERM the tool.
//
// An unknown or unreadable leader falls back to 2, which is the conservative
// direction: it can under-register, never signal the tool by mistake.

// reading .mcp.json — agent-deck never holds the exec.Cmd handle
// directly, so this discovery is the only point at which their PIDs
// become known to a per-session lifecycle hook.
//
// Filtering rules:
//   - Pane PID itself is skipped: tmux teardown signals it directly.
//   - The tool process (claude/codex/gemini) is skipped: tmux's
//     pgroup-wide kill-session is the right path for it, and
//     pre-empting that with SIGTERM causes the session to
//     auto-destroy before kill-session runs, which surfaces a
//     cosmetic teardown error.
//   - Everything deeper IS registered: this is where stdio MCPs and
//     their helpers (uvx, python, node, bun) live. Some MCPs setsid
//     into their own session, escaping tmux's pgroup kill — those
//     are exactly the leakers from issue #965.
